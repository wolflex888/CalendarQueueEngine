# CalendarQueueEngine
This is a homework done in Georgia Intitute of Technology CSE 6010
HW3 - Call center simulation


The simulation application is named: HW3_app.c
The engine is named: engine.c
There is an additional file called Queue.c that contains the FIFO queue for incoming callers
The header file associated with that is FIFO_TEST.h
The header file for the simulation is called sim.h and was derived from the sample sim.h
file that Dr. Fujimoto gave us as a sample. 

The programs need to be compiled together:gcc HW3_App.c engine.c
